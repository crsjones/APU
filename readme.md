This is the library in Z80 form based on the work of Herb Johnson;

http://retrotechnology.com/herbs_stuff/float.html

I have added a basic menu to show how to use the library, using the emulated 6850 terminal provided
by ASM80.(asm80.com)

## run the code
Paste this URL into ASM80's "Import Repo from Github" option, "compile" the file
Build.z80 and then "emulate".
