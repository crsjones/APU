This is the library in Z80 form from;

http://retrotechnology.com/herbs_stuff/float.html

I have added a basic menu to show how to use the library, using the emulated 6850 terminal provided
by ASM80.

## run the code
Paste the URL into ASM80's "Import Repo from Github" option, "compile" the file
Build.z80 and then "emulate".
